## Introduction

In this project, I built a CRUD REST API using Node.js and Express. This API allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data. I detail the steps I took to create this API, what I learned along the way, and provide the complete source code for reference.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
